%% Using elixir as a rebar dependency

%% This configuration file only exists so Elixir can be used
%% as a raw rebar dependency:
%%
%%     {elixir, ".*",
%%      {git, "git://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir.git"},
%%      [raw]}.
%%
%%
%% In practice, Elixir is structured as OTP where many applications
%% are placed in the lib directory. Since this structure is not
%% supported by default by rebar, after adding Elixir as a dependency
%% you need to explicitly add it to lib_dirs:
%%
%%     {lib_dirs, ["deps/elixir/lib"]}.
%%

%% Run make as the proper compilation step
{ post_hooks, [{compile,"make compile"}] }.

%% This prevents rebar_elixir_plugin from recompiling Elixir
{ ex_opts, [{src_dirs, [".PHONY"]}] }.
